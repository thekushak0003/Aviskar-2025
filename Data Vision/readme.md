# 🎓 Student Dropout Prediction System  
### AVISKAR 2025 – Data Vision Project  

📌 **An end-to-end Machine Learning & Streamlit-based system to analyze, predict, and visualize student dropout risk using academic, demographic, and financial data.**

---

## 🌟 Project Overview

Student dropout is one of the most critical challenges in higher education. This project aims to:

- Analyze **why students drop out**
- Identify **key academic & financial risk factors**
- Build a **machine learning model** to predict dropout risk
- Deploy a **full-featured Streamlit web application** for:
  - Data exploration
  - Model evaluation
  - Real-time dropout prediction

This project is developed as part of **AVISKAR 2025 – Data Vision Problem Statement: Student Dropout Prediction System**.
